I am a former research assistant at Harvard University in the Cognitive Neuropsychology Lab of Alfonso Caramazza. During my time there, I collaborated with a postdoctoral fellow on a project investigating bilingual aphasia using fMRI. Previously, I pursued my undergraduate studies in linguistics and cognitive science at Johns Hopkins University, where I explored the relationship between language and cognition. Currently, I am seeking new opportunities to further my research and teaching endeavors in my adopted home of Washington, D.C.!

For the Love of Language
======
I am fully committed to making education about language, thought, and intelligence accessible and comprehensible to the general public as well as young scholars. I firmly believe that an understanding of the arbitrary nature of perception and language can build empathy, communication, and encourage people to practice lifelong learning of creative skills and languages. If you have an interest in learning more about any of the following topics, let me know and I will put together a reading list!

* Language and Intelligence: What is the cognitive benefit of bilingualism in memory and creative problem-solving?
* Models of Learning: How can language acquisition research be used to improve language processing models?
* Cognitive Bias leads to Linguistic Patterns: What type of pattern-solving skills are utilized in language acquisition vs. other forms of learning? How do theories of linguistics pair with neuropsychological research?
* Second language acquisition: What makes acquiring a language in adolescence/adulthood so different? Are there differences in cognitive and neural development between monolingual and bilingual children?
* Perception and Cognition: How does knowledge of a specific language affect perception, memory, representation, and learning?

I have extensive experience as a teaching assistant, peer mentor, and private tutor. One day, I'd like to combine my passion for research and teaching to work as a professor or scientific communicator. If you have an interest in joining me in this pursuit, reach out anytime!

Reviews from Former Students
======
This is what some of my students at Harvard/Johns Hopkins have said about me on recent course evaluations!
* *Brody was super enthusiastic during section. His feedback on written assignments was particularly helpful.*
* *Thank you Brody Silva for all of your hardwork. There was one time that I couldn't meet to review over work and he made time for me before section early friday morning. He met me an hour early and went over subject matter and information that I was confused on. I wouldn't have survived (barely) without all of your help. And I loved section! You are funny, personal, and interesting to listen to. really nice and outgoing ... [and] made section really fun and interesting!*
* *Super engaging! Very good at fostering participation from everyone, and was clearly passionate about the subject material.*
* *Brody is awesome! Psych section was one of the highlights of my week! I loved how discussion-based it was.*
* *Great teacher and a cool person overall. Brody was enthusiastic as as section leader. He was personable and energetic, which definitely made section more enjoyable!*
* Mean rating of 4.79/5 by students of a 100+ person class.
