I'm a research assistant at Harvard University in the Cognitive Neuropsychology Lab of Alfonso Caramazza. There, I work with postdoc Esti Blanco-Elorrieta on a project studying bilingual aphasia using fMRI. Previously, I was an undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University studying linguistics and cognitive science, investigating the connections between how and why language exists. I'm looking to apply to graduate programs this fall!

For the Love of Language

I am fully committed to making education about language, thought, and intelligence accessible and comprehensible to the general public as well as young scholars. I firmly beleive that an understanding of the arbitrary nature of perception and language can build empathy, communication, and encourage people to practice lifelong learning of creative skills and languages. If you have an interest in learning more about any of the following topics, let me know and I will put together a reading list!

* Language and Intelligence: What is the cognitive benefit of bilingualism in memory and creative problem-solving?
* Models of Learning: How does language acquisition research be used to improve language processing models?
* Cognitive Bias leads to Linguistic Patterns: What type of pattern-solving skills are utilized in language acquisition v.s. other forms of learning? How do theories of linguistics pair with neuropsychological research?
* Second language acquisition: What makes acquiring a language in adolescence/adulthood so different than natural ? Are there differences in cognitive and neural development between monolingual and bilingual children?
* Perception and Cognition: How does knowledge of a specific language affect perception, memory, representation, and 

I have extensive experience as a teaching assistant, peer mentor, and private tutor. One day, I'd like to combine my passion for research and teaching to work as a proffesor or scientific communicator. If you have an interest in joining me in this pursuit, reach out anytime!
