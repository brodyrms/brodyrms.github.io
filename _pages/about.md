I'm a senior undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University studying linguistics and cognitive science, investigating the connections between how and why language exists.

For the Love of Learning
======
I am fully committed to making education about language, thought, and intelligence accessible and comprehensible to the general public as well as young scholars. If you have an interest in learning more about any of the following topics, let me know and I will put together a reading list!
* Foundational Cognitive Science
* Language and Intelligence
* Models of decision making and reasoning
* Understanding how human biases and logic affect the world we build
* Developmental abilities of the mind
* Second language acquisition
* Perception and Cognition: what's the difference?

My positions
======
1. I believe that human exceptionalism relies on the use of language for complex representations of ideas, agents, and processes in the mind. Without language, we can't move past that initial discovery system of core abilities.
1. Bayesian models of decision making incorporate both prior knowledge available from the developmental system and new evidence as time continues, striking an important balance between the nativist/empiricist debate.
1. Given the opportunity, I'd like to explore the use of neuroplastic principles in designing neural networks. When bridging the gap between stability and plasticity, we should rely more heavily on neuroscience findings to guide cognitive models.
2. Cognition is NOT a "black-box"; we only have to investigate the discreet differences in input-output relations to begin building a comprehensive map of every cognitive ability, then weave them all together with domain-general and domain-specific theories of processing.
